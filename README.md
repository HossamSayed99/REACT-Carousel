# REACT Carousel

![Show Case GIF](./ScreenRecorderProject2_1.gif)

A carousel implemented using REACT framework. The environment was set up manually using **WebPack** as a bundler and **Babel** as a compiler. 



## How to set up the application
You need to have nodejs installed on your machine.<br>
Clone the repo and execute `npm install` then execute `npm run start`. Hopefully, this will get everyrunning! 


## Most Valuable Resources
These are the resources which I have mainly used to make this component possible:
*   https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
*   https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658
*    https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/
*   https://betterprogramming.pub/building-a-modern-react-app-from-scratch-in-2021-d2071c31c98

## Challenges Faced
*   The blog mentioned in the react docs to configure react environment from scratch (second link) is outdated.
*   The legendary "centering page content" challenge!
*   Getting the navigation buttons to work. (This was because the silliest and most irritating bug ever!)

## Future Work
*   Making the pictures resize automatically to the screen size. I beleive using this could be made using media queries.
  

## Finl thoughts
In this task, I have spent more time with tweaking the front end that finishing the logic of the carrousel (which has nearly no logic to be fair). I have got a fair idea of REACT and how its development methodology is different in terms of dividing everything into components. I have also read about some features like react hooks.
